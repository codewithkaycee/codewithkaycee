# web1.0- Read-only web.

Web 1.0 is the first evolution of the world wide web(WWW). 
*According to Tim-Bernes Lee, web1.0 is a Read-only web*. here users come to the webpage to consume content/ information â„¹, but can't interact with the server-side. 
Web1.0 consists of the web serving static HTML content where the users were not able to interact with the static webpage. See it this way web1 is just like a newspaper to the computer ðŸ–¥ where you can just read a bunch of information but no interactivity.
>  Web 1.0 lasted approximately from 1991 to 2004.

#### Characteristics of web1.0 

- read-only content.
- static web pages.
- Content is served from the serverâ€™s file system.
-  Pages built and sent by Server Side.



# web2.0- Read-write web.
> web2 was the second iteration of  the internet, launched in the early 2000s



Now I thank my God for not experiencing the web1.0 era. ðŸ˜† because shit was boring ASF, no user interaction but in web2 that's the opposite. This is the version of the web that we all are familiar with. like Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, and many more that I can't mention. In web2 you and I consume and create content and still interact with the other web users and comment, share, and like the content on the web. Unlike web1.0 where developers are mostly in control of all content on the web. 
**Web2 is simple to navigate**, and millions are becoming creators. Web2 is built on a centralized nature. Meaning you are not in control over your data. Now let me break it down a little bit. In web2.0 sites like Twitter, Google, Facebook, and the rest of web2 platforms were built in a way that before you make use of their application you will need to submit some of your details like password, ids,  permissions to access your location, requires your age and date of birth, phone number, and Emails, etc. On this web, you are not in control. As a content creator, you can lose everything just in a sec. as a web2 user your data is not secured, your data can get leaked by the platform, and all your content can be taken down in a sec, you must accept the terms and conditions of the platform.

####  Characteristics of web2.0 

- dynamic content.
- scalability.
- interactive (content, and social networking).
- Rich user interface & experience. 

## Problems with web2.0 



1. CENTRALIZATION: the company which built the app for the user has control and central authority over their data.  Companies have the access to the user data with which they can do whatever they want like advertising and recommendations.

PRIVACY: The authority has to monitor everything we do on web2. like things we search and watch on the web, our private chat, location, and details are all monitored. with web2 we don't have freedom.
- SECURITY: cybercriminals can access our information on the social web. our data can be hijacked by hackers. on the social networking web, we put out our details such as phone numbers, addresses, and locations on the social networking profiles which criminals can take advantage of. 
- FREEDOM: These centralized organizations can shut down your data whenever they want. you can be stopped from posting informative content if the authority doesn't agree with your information.

# Web 3.0 Read-write-own 
> with web3 we can solve the problems we have with web2.

web3 is referred to as the Third generation of the internet service (though in its infancy). It's internet-based on the decentralization web. meaning it's a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers that runs without the need for middlemen (intermediaries).

> web3 was coined by Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Ethereum in 2014.

Web3.0 doesn't run on a single server or stores data in a single database, instead, they run on a decentralized application (dapps) on the **BLOCKCHAIN ** network of computer, instead of a single computer. LOL don't freak out we will still understand what blockchain is. Dapps are decentralized applications meaning they are free to control and interfere with a single authority.

#### Characteristics of web3 



- **Decentralized network **: they are free from the control of a single authority.


- **Trustless**: you don't have to trust a third party.  

- **User anonymity**: you don't need to submit any personal info like age, name, gender, or location. you just need a wallet address in web3.

- **self-governing**

- **Distributed**
